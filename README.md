AT.ProcessMonitor
=================
Monitors processes and and (depending on configuration) starts/restarts and (for programs designed to work with this process monitor) logs and emails exceptions.

NOTE: Some features will not work if you compile this program as 32 bit and try to get it to interact with 64 bit processes.
